# DSA Implementations in Python and JavaScript

Welcome to the DSA Implementations repository! This repository contains various data structures and algorithms (DSA) implemented in both Python and JavaScript. The goal of this project is to provide clear, well-documented examples of common DSA concepts, which can be used as a learning resource or as a reference for your own projects.

## Overview

This repository includes implementations of essential data structures and algorithms such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, and more. Each implementation is provided in both Python and JavaScript, making it easy to compare and learn both languages.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, simply clone it to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sheriff-Oladimeji/DSA.git
cd DSA
```

Ensure you have Python and Node.js installed on your machine to run the implementations in the respective languages.

### Python

To run Python implementations, you can execute them using the Python interpreter:

```bash
python path/to/your/python_file.py
```

### JavaScript

To run JavaScript implementations, you can execute them using Node.js:

```bash
node path/to/your/javascript_file.js
```
